# TomMakeathon Mobile Sensory Unit project! 
- This was developed on PlatformIO but the code is completely compatible
   with the standard Arduino IDE (just remove the #include <arduino.h>
- this project runs on two arduino nanos that communicate with each other via UART
- Feel free to use this code as an example using the Fast LED library with an arduino
